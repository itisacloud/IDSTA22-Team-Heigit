3.2:
Text is "drawn" on a page through various instructions. 
Thus the text is not represented in a certain encoding in 
a row with fixed distance but all characters are represented 
at certain positions in rows and columns (similarly pixels with PNGs).
 This means that a word or sentence cannot be read by the machine as we
 then see it displayed on the screen, but the individual sentence and word
 parts can be "painted" onto their positions in a jumbled manner.
 The encoding is also a problem, since each character can have a different
 font, which in turn has its own encoding. Also whitespaces can be 
represented in different ways, which cannot all be converted into a 
whitespace character in a string without detours. Text can also be 
invisible, written outside the visible area and with the same color
 as the background.

3.4:
The script we used here did not extract any text from the scans,
 because the script as we wrote it does not allow conversion of 
an image from text to machine-readable text. However, a combination of 
other packages could make this possible (cf. 
https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/extract-text-from-images-or-scanned-pdf-python)

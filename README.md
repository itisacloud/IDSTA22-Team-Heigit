# Introduction

"[E]verything is related to everything else, but near things are more related
than distant things". 
Tobler’s first rule was abruptly brought to the at-
tention of the people of Europe, and Germany in particular, as a result of
Russia’s attack on Ukraine in february 2022. In addition to the mental factor
of having a war not far from the own borders, the population is particularly
affected by the strong dependence on Russian resources due to the geograph-
ical proximity. 

In order to pre-empt an escalation of political tensions within the population, 
it is therefore useful to create an overview of the spatial distribution of
residents who support or do not support the government’s current direction
and which events have had an impact on public perception.
As one of the most well-known social media platforms that offers the pos-
sibility to export content and geolocation of a message, Twitter represents
the best opportunity to analyze the influence of socio-economic factors and
geopolitical events on social attitudes towards the war in Ukraine.



# Tweets

In order to retrieve tweets sent from Germany that address Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we relied on the R package [academictwitteR](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md). We were able to retrieve 106.000 tweets.

Most of the tweets were written in german. Nevertheless, we also identified tweets in russian, polish, turkish and ukrainian.
